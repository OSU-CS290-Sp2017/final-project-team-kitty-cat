Left Column:

The left column would push channel elements like a stack data structure whenever a user joins a conversation. 
Inside each pushed channel, a circle with a number in the middle of it will show how many new messages have been sent 
in the channel while browsing other ones. Also if the user wants to leave a channel, it will be pushed out of the stack and 
removed from the left column. When the user clicks on one of the channels, then the browser will open the channel in the 
middle column.

Middle Column:

Middle column will be endless with user created channels! This is the community of channels so a user can
browse through and pick which channel to be apart of. When the user clicks on the channel it will use a drop down
box to display the channels conversation. 

Right Column:

When a user is in a channel, the right column will display the details of the current channel created by the user 
who created the channel. Below that if we integrate profiles we can display the users profile pictures.

Schematically is this how you guys would like the appearance and flow of our website?
